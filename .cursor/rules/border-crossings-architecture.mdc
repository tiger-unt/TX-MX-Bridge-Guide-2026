# Texas-Mexico Border Crossings Website Architecture

**Project Overview:** Automated website + PDF generation system for Texas-Mexico international border crossings guide. Replaces manual ArcGIS StoryMap workflow with single source of truth approach.

**Full Plan Reference:** See `WEBSITE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for complete details, timeline, and implementation phases.

## Core Architecture Principle

**Single Source of Truth:** All content managed in structured data files that automatically generate both website pages and PDF fact sheets.

## Three-Tier Data Management

1. **ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Web Map** - Interactive map display
   - Web Developer updates in AGOL portal
   - Changes appear instantly (no deployment needed)

2. **CSV File** - Structured border crossing data (30+ bilingual columns)
   - Names, coordinates, statistics, hours, tolls, descriptions
   - Generates individual crossing pages and PDFs
   - Content Manager edits in SharePoint Excel

3. **Markdown Files** - Long-form narrative content
   - Regional histories and detailed stories
   - Content Manager edits in SharePoint/GitHub
   - Populates region overview pages

## Critical Requirements

**Bilingual Content (EN/ES):**
- All crossing data must have English and Spanish versions
- PDF layouts must accommodate different text lengths
- Language switcher on all pages

**PDF Generation:**
- Must match 2-3 page format (mostly 3 pages)
- Automated generation from CSV data
- Pixel-perfect layout precision required

**Team Roles:**
- **Web Developer:** Data structure, build scripts, deployment, AGOL configuration
- **Content Manager:** Data accuracy, content updates, statistics, bilingual validation

## Key Technical Components

- Automated build system (CSV + Markdown → HTML + PDF)
- ArcGIS Online (AGOL) map integration with scroll animations
- Single AGOL map reused across 3 region pages (different zoom/center)
- Interactive data visualizations (converting static guidebook charts)
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Content Update Workflow

- **AGOL Map:** Edit in portal → Save → Instant update
- **CSV/Markdown:** Edit in SharePoint/GitHub → Build → Deploy
