# Texas-Mexico International Border Crossings
Connecting People and Goods Across the Texas-Mexico Border: A Guide to the State's Border Crossings

![Hero background](../assets/Transition-Images/CoverImage_v1.png)

<!-- section: intro -->
This guide provides information about the importance of the Texas-Mexico border and the border crossings in three regions (El Paso, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley). It presents trade and crossing volume data at two levels: (1) district aggregate totals showing total trade and crossing volumes for each region, and (2) individual crossing details for each Port of Entry and bridge.

The data covers trends in cross-border trade (by commercial truck and rail) and travel (by passenger vehicle, bus, and as a pedestrian/bicyclist) for the period 2014 to 2024, along with information on planned future international bridges and border crossings.
