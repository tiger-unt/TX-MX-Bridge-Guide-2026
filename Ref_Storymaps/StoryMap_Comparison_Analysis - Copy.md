**Story Maps Analyzed and Compared:**
1. **Connectivity Plan Story Map:** [Texas-Mexico Border Region Connectivity Plan](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ac9bf9b365f842e29d7316dbbf282b2b)
2. **Border Crossings Guide Story Map:** [Texas-Mexico International Border Crossings](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3f37b60a6edb4ac7b9cd03114cd33ed8)

### Key Findings

**Primary Difference: Regional vs. Individual Crossing/bridge Focus**
- **Connectivity Plan** Defines binational economic regions (West, Central, South) spanning 100 miles on both sides of the border.
- **Border Crossings Guide** Summary and detailed port of entry (trade) and border crossing/bridge information by TxDOT district:  El Paso, Laredo, Rio Grande Valley

**Data Consistency**
Both StoryMaps use Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and are consistent in identifying:
- Top commodity types: machinery/electrical equipment, transportation equipment, metals, plastics/rubbers
- Truck dominance (~80% of trade value)
- Similar pandemic recovery patterns (2020-2021 disruptions, subsequent recovery)

### Regional Definition Implications

| Aspect | Connectivity Plan Regions | Border Crossings Guide Regions |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Geographic Scope** | Binational (100-mile buffer both sides of Texas-Mexico border) | Texas-Mexico bridge crossing locations and POEs by TxDOT District |
| **Population** | 13.6 million (both countries) | Not included |
| **Boundary Type** | Economic/functional regions | TxDOT border district) |
| **Mexican Information** | Socio-Economic data for Mexican states and binational economics | Focus on Texas. Bridge information (bridge owner, bridge operator, bridge acess road, and tolls) available for Mexico  |
| **What Defines the "Region"** | Geographic area with economic interdependence | TxDOT Border District boundaries
| **Planning Horizon** | Long-range (2050 projections) | Focus on 2024 data |
| **Key Metrics** | Employment, GDP, freight tonnage by corridor | Trade value and volumes by TxDOT district (aggregate); by Port of Entry/bridge (individual) data |

## 3. Trade Statistics Reconciliation

### Overall Texas-Mexico Trade

| Metric | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide | Explanation |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Data Year** | 2023 | 2024 | Different reporting periods |
| **Total Trade** | $468B ($207B SB + $261B NB) | $552.9B | Year difference + methodology |
| **Truck Trade** | ~80% of total | $454.5B (82% of total) | Consistent proportion |
| **Rail Trade** | ~16% of total | $88.8B (16% of total) | Exact match |
| **Other Modes** | ~4% | $9.6B (2%) | Pipeline, air, vessel, FTZ |

**Reconciliation Notes:**
- The $84.9B difference is primarily due to the one-year gap (2023 vs 2024)
- Trade grew significantly between 2023 and 2024, consistent with historical trends
- Both sources use BTS Transborder Data, ensuring methodological consistency
- Connectivity Plan may exclude some modes (pipeline, Free Trade Zones) that Border Crossings Guide includes

### Top Commodities Comparison

Both documents identify the same top commodity categories (terminology varies slightly):

| Rank | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide | Alignment |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | High Tech / Electrical Products | Machinery/Electrical Equipment | ✓ Same |
| 2 | Motor Vehicles | Transportation Equipment | ✓ Same |
| 3 | Machinery (Industrial) | Metals | ✓ Top 3 |
| 4 | Chemicals | Plastics/Rubbers | ✓ Top 5 |
| 5 | Metal Products | Mineral Products | ✓ Top 5 |

**Note:** The exact ranking and dollar values differ slightly due to classification systems, but there is strong agreement on the dominant commodity types.

### Infrastructure Inventory Reconciliation

| Category | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Border Crossings** | 28 total | 34 operational |  
| **Truck-Capable** | 18 | 14 (4+4+6) | 
| **Rail Bridges** | 4 operational | 5 operational |
| **Ports of Entry** | Not specified | 12 | 
| **Airports** | 8 commercial | Lists airports included in POEs | 
| **Deep Draft Ports** | 2 | 1 (Brownsville) | 
| **Shallow Draft Ports** | 3 | NA
