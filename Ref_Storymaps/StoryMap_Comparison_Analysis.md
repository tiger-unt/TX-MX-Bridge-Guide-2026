## Executive Summary

This analysis compares two complementary TxDOT Story Maps focused on the Texas-Mexico border region: the **Connectivity Plan Story Map** and the **Border Crossings Guide Story Map**. While both documents address the critical role of border infrastructure in facilitating trade and travel between Texas and Mexico, they serve distinct but complementary purposes.

### Key Findings

**Primary Difference: Regional vs. Crossing-Based Focus**
- **Connectivity Plan** uses binational economic regions (West, Central, South) spanning 100 miles on both sides of the border, encompassing 13.6 million people across Texas and Mexico - the geographic region matters for transportation corridor planning
- **Border Crossings Guide** groups border crossings by TxDOT district (El Paso, Laredo, Rio Grande Valley) and provides data at two levels: **individual crossing performance** (by Port of Entry and bridge) and **district aggregate totals** (total trade and crossing volumes for all crossings in each district)

**Complementary Scopes**
- **Connectivity Plan**: Long-range transportation planning with 2050 projections, infrastructure needs assessment, and multimodal connectivity recommendations for regional corridors
- **Border Crossings Guide**: Current operational data (2024) at two levels - individual crossing details (by Port of Entry and bridge) and district aggregate totals (total trade and crossing volumes for each TxDOT district)

**Data Consistency**
Both documents use Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) as their primary data source and consistently identify:
- Laredo as the dominant trade gateway (handling 45-63% of regional trade)
- Top commodity types: machinery/electrical equipment, transportation equipment, metals, plastics/rubbers
- Truck dominance (~80% of trade value)
- Similar pandemic recovery patterns (2020-2021 disruptions, subsequent recovery)

**Strategic Value**
The different organizational approaches serve different purposes and audiences:
- **Connectivity Plan** supports binational economic development and regional transportation corridor planning - geographic regions matter
- **Border Crossings Guide** provides both district-level totals and individual crossing data - enables comparison between districts and between individual crossings
- Together, they provide comprehensive coverage from regional strategic planning to facility-level operational execution
- Key distinction: One analyzes geographic regions for planning; the other reports crossing operations grouped by district

### Border Crossings Guide Story Map Regions (Grouped by TxDOT District)

**Note:** The Border Crossings Guide provides data at two levels: (1) **district aggregate totals** showing total trade and crossing volumes for all crossings in each TxDOT district, and (2) **individual crossing performance** for each Port of Entry and bridge. The focus is on crossing operations and trade volumes - not district geography or population.

| Region | Ports of Entry & Border Crossings | Trade at Crossings (2024) | Crossing Infrastructure | Crossing Volumes (2024) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

### Regional Definition Implications

| Aspect | Connectivity Plan Regions | Border Crossings Guide Regions |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Geographic Scope** | Binational (100-mile buffer both sides) | Border crossing locations only (not geographic regions) |
| **Population Coverage** | 13.6 million (both countries) | Not applicable - focuses on crossings, not population |
| **Boundary Type** | Economic/functional regions | Organizational grouping (border crossings grouped by TxDOT district) |
| **Mexican Integration** | Includes Mexican states and binational economics | References Mexican crossing partners but focuses on U.S. side operations |
| **What Defines the "Region"** | Geographic area with economic interdependence | Collection of border crossings grouped by TxDOT district location |
| **Planning Horizon** | Long-range (2050 projections) | Current operations (2024 data) |
| **Primary Use Case** | Economic development, corridor planning, infrastructure needs | Crossing operations, trade statistics, facility specifications |
| **Key Metrics** | Employment, GDP, freight tonnage by corridor | Trade value and volumes by district (aggregate); by Port of Entry/bridge (individual) |

**Key Insight:** These are fundamentally different organizational approaches:
- **Connectivity Plan** uses true geographic regions defined by economic zones and transportation corridors - the region itself matters for planning
- **Border Crossings Guide** groups border crossings by TxDOT district and reports both district totals and individual crossing data - the district grouping is for organizational convenience
- The Border Crossings Guide enables comparisons at two levels: between districts (El Paso vs. Laredo vs. RGV totals) and between individual crossings
- Direct geographic comparison is limited because one analyzes regions while the other reports crossing operations grouped by district

## 3. Trade Statistics Reconciliation

### Overall Texas-Mexico Trade

| Metric | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide | Explanation |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Data Year** | 2023 | 2024 | Different reporting periods |
| **Total Trade** | $468B ($207B SB + $261B NB) | $552.9B | Year difference + methodology |
| **Truck Trade** | ~80% of total | $454.5B (82% of total) | Consistent proportion |
| **Rail Trade** | ~16% of total | $88.8B (16% of total) | Exact match |
| **Other Modes** | ~4% | $9.6B (2%) | Pipeline, air, vessel, FTZ |

**Reconciliation Notes:**
- The $84.9B difference is primarily due to the one-year gap (2023 vs 2024)
- Trade grew significantly between 2023 and 2024, consistent with historical trends
- Both sources use BTS Transborder Data, ensuring methodological consistency
- Connectivity Plan may exclude some modes (pipeline, Free Trade Zones) that Border Crossings Guide includes

### Regional Trade Distribution

#### West/El Paso Region

| Metric | Connectivity Plan (2023) | Border Crossings Guide (2024) | Notes |

| **% of Texas Total** | ~9% (estimated) | ~12% | Growing share |

### Top Commodities Comparison

Both documents identify the same top commodity categories (terminology varies slightly):

| Rank | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide | Alignment |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | High Tech / Electrical Products | Machinery/Electrical Equipment | ✓ Same |
| 2 | Motor Vehicles | Transportation Equipment | ✓ Same |
| 3 | Machinery (Industrial) | Metals | ✓ Top 3 |
| 4 | Chemicals | Plastics/Rubbers | ✓ Top 5 |
| 5 | Metal Products | Mineral Products | ✓ Top 5 |

**Note:** The exact ranking and dollar values differ slightly due to classification systems, but there is strong agreement on the dominant commodity types.

### Infrastructure Inventory Reconciliation

| Category | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide | Reconciliation |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Border Crossings** | 28 total | 34 operational | BCG counts individual crossing lanes/spans; CP may count POEs |
| **Truck-Capable** | 18 | 14 (4+4+6) | BCG provides exact breakdown by region |
| **Rail Crossings** | 4 operational | 5 total (1 very recent) | Patrick J. Ottensmeyer Bridge opened Dec 2024 |
| **Ports of Entry** | Not specified | 12 | BCG provides POE-level organization |
| **Airports** | 8 commercial | Listed by region | Same facilities, different organization |
| **Deep Draft Ports** | 2 | 1 (Brownsville) | CP includes additional Texas Gulf ports |
| **Shallow Draft Ports** | 3 | Brownsville mentioned | Different scope |

**Explanation:** The discrepancy in crossing counts stems from different counting methodologies:
- **Connectivity Plan**: Counts POEs or major crossing facilities
- **Border Crossings Guide**: Counts individual operational crossing points, including separate spans of the same bridge

## 6. Methodology Differences Explained

### Regional vs. Crossing-Based Organization

**Why Different:**
- **Connectivity Plan** serves economic development and binational planning → uses functional economic regions that matter for transportation corridor analysis
- **Border Crossings Guide** serves operational crossing management → uses TxDOT districts as an administrative organizing tool, but the focus is on **the border crossings themselves, not the district geography**
- Different purposes require different organizational frameworks

**Impact on Data:**
- **Connectivity Plan**: Regional trade flows, corridor utilization, county-to-county movements - the geographic region matters
- **Border Crossings Guide**: Trade and volume by Port of Entry and individual crossing - the specific crossing location matters, not the surrounding area
- Trade statistics are organized differently: by economic region vs. by border crossing facility
- The Border Crossings Guide could reorganize crossings by other criteria (trade volume, crossing type, etc.) without changing its fundamental purpose

**Resolution:**
- Do NOT try to compare "regions" directly - they represent different concepts
- **Connectivity Plan regions** = geographic areas with transportation corridors
- **Border Crossings Guide "regions"** = administrative groupings of border crossing facilities
- Focus comparisons on Port of Entry performance rather than regional geography

### Time Period Differences

**Why Different:**
- Connectivity Plan published in 2025 using 2023 trade data (most recent available at time of analysis)
- Border Crossings Guide published annually with most current year's data (2024)
- Major plans update every 3-5 years; operational guides update annually

**Impact on Data:**
- Absolute dollar values differ due to year-over-year growth
- Percentages and trends remain comparable
- 2023 to 2024 saw continued trade growth post-pandemic

**Resolution:**
- Always note the data year when citing statistics
- Focus on trends and percentages rather than absolute values when comparing
- Use year-over-year growth rates to estimate reconciliation

### Infrastructure Counting Methodology

**Why Different:**
- Connectivity Plan counts POEs or major gateway facilities (network planning perspective)
- Border Crossings Guide counts individual operational crossing points including separate bridge spans
- Different levels of granularity for different purposes

**Impact on Data:**
- "28 bridges" vs "34 operational border crossings"
- Both are correct from their respective perspectives
- Creates confusion without explanation

**Resolution:**
- Border Crossings Guide provides most accurate operational count (34)
- Connectivity Plan's count (28) may exclude some small crossings or count dual spans as one
- Use Border Crossings Guide for precise facility inventory
- Use Connectivity Plan for network-level analysis

### Trade Value vs. Tonnage

**Why Different:**
- Connectivity Plan emphasizes truck freight tonnage (tons) for capacity planning
- Border Crossings Guide emphasizes trade value (dollars) for economic impact
- Different metrics serve different analytical needs

**Impact on Data:**
- Cannot directly compare tonnage to dollar values
- High-value, low-weight commodities (electronics) vs. low-value, high-weight commodities (minerals)
- Different rankings of regions based on metric used

**Resolution:**
- Use tonnage for infrastructure capacity planning (Connectivity Plan)
- Use dollar values for economic impact analysis (Border Crossings Guide)
- Recognize that Laredo dominates by both metrics

---

## Conclusion

The Connectivity Plan Story Map and Border Crossings Guide Story Map are complementary resources that serve fundamentally different purposes. Rather than viewing their differences as discrepancies, they should be understood as intentional design choices:

- **Connectivity Plan**: Strategic, binational, long-range planning document analyzing **economic regions and transportation corridors** for transportation professionals and policymakers
- **Border Crossings Guide**: Operational data for **border crossings** providing both district aggregate totals and individual crossing performance data for the public and border managers

**Key Distinction:** The Connectivity Plan analyzes geographic regions for corridor planning; the Border Crossings Guide reports crossing operations grouped by TxDOT district. The Border Crossings Guide provides data at two levels: district totals (all crossings in El Paso, Laredo, or RGV) and individual crossing performance (each Port of Entry and bridge).

When used together, these documents provide:
1. Regional corridor planning context (Connectivity Plan) + District and crossing-level operational data (Border Crossings Guide)
2. Long-range infrastructure needs (2050 projections) + Current crossing performance (2024 data)
3. Binational economic analysis + U.S.-side crossing operations (district totals and individual crossings)
4. Corridor tonnage flows + Port of Entry trade values and district aggregate totals

**Recommendation:** Maintain both documents with their distinct focuses. Do NOT attempt to force geographic alignment between them. Instead:
- Link from Connectivity Plan regional analysis to relevant Border Crossings Guide Port of Entry pages
- Link from Border Crossings Guide crossing data to relevant Connectivity Plan corridor needs
- Create a brief guide explaining: "Use Connectivity Plan for corridor planning; use Border Crossings Guide for crossing selection and performance"
