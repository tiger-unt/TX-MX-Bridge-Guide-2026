### Key Findings

**Primary Difference: Regional vs. Individual Crossing/bridge Focus**
- **Connectivity Plan** Defines binational economic regions (West, Central, South) spanning 100 miles on both sides of the border.
- **Border Crossings Guide** Summary and detailed port of entry (trade) and border crossing/bridge information by TxDOT district:  El Paso, Laredo, Rio Grande Valley

**Data Consistency**
Both StoryMaps use Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and are consistent in identifying:
- Top commodity types: machinery/electrical equipment, transportation equipment, metals, plastics/rubbers
- Truck dominance (~80% of trade value)
- Similar pandemic recovery patterns (2020-2021 disruptions, subsequent recovery)

## 3. Trade Statistics Reconciliation

### Overall Texas-Mexico Trade

| Metric | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide | Explanation |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Data Year** | 2023 | 2024 | Different reporting periods |
| **Total Trade** | $468B ($207B SB + $261B NB) | $552.9B | Year difference + methodology |
| **Truck Trade** | ~80% of total | $454.5B (82% of total) | Consistent proportion |
| **Rail Trade** | ~16% of total | $88.8B (16% of total) | Exact match |
| **Other Modes** | ~4% | $9.6B (2%) | Pipeline, air, vessel, FTZ |

**Reconciliation Notes:**
- The $84.9B difference is primarily due to the one-year gap (2023 vs 2024)
- Trade grew significantly between 2023 and 2024, consistent with historical trends
- Both sources use BTS Transborder Data, ensuring methodological consistency
- Connectivity Plan may exclude some modes (pipeline, Free Trade Zones) that Border Crossings Guide includes

### Top Commodities Comparison

Both documents identify the same top commodity categories (terminology varies slightly):

| Rank | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide | Alignment |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | High Tech / Electrical Products | Machinery/Electrical Equipment | ✓ Same |
| 2 | Motor Vehicles | Transportation Equipment | ✓ Same |
| 3 | Machinery (Industrial) | Metals | ✓ Top 3 |
| 4 | Chemicals | Plastics/Rubbers | ✓ Top 5 |
| 5 | Metal Products | Mineral Products | ✓ Top 5 |

**Note:** The exact ranking and dollar values differ slightly due to classification systems, but there is strong agreement on the dominant commodity types.

### Infrastructure Inventory Reconciliation

| Category | Connectivity Plan | Border Crossings Guide |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Border Crossings** | 28 total | 34 operational |  
| **Truck-Capable** | 18 | 14 (4+4+6) | 
| **Rail Bridges** | 4 operational | 5 operational |
| **Ports of Entry** | Not specified | 12 | 
| **Airports** | 8 commercial | Lists airports included in POEs | 
| **Deep Draft Ports** | 2 | 1 (Brownsville) | 
| **Shallow Draft Ports** | 3 | NA

**Explanation:** The discrepancy in crossing counts stems from different counting methodologies:
- **Connectivity Plan**: Counts POEs or major crossing facilities
- **Border Crossings Guide**: Counts individual operational crossing points, including separate spans of the same bridge

## 6. Methodology Differences Explained

### Regional vs. Crossing-Based Organization

**Why Different:**
- **Connectivity Plan** serves economic development and binational planning → uses functional economic regions that matter for transportation corridor analysis
- **Border Crossings Guide** serves operational crossing management → uses TxDOT districts as an administrative organizing tool, but the focus is on **the border crossings themselves, not the district geography**
- Different purposes require different organizational frameworks

**Impact on Data:**
- **Connectivity Plan**: Regional trade flows, corridor utilization, county-to-county movements - the geographic region matters
- **Border Crossings Guide**: Trade and volume by Port of Entry and individual crossing - the specific crossing location matters, not the surrounding area
- Trade statistics are organized differently: by economic region vs. by border crossing facility
- The Border Crossings Guide could reorganize crossings by other criteria (trade volume, crossing type, etc.) without changing its fundamental purpose

**Resolution:**
- Do NOT try to compare "regions" directly - they represent different concepts
- **Connectivity Plan regions** = geographic areas with transportation corridors
- **Border Crossings Guide "regions"** = administrative groupings of border crossing facilities
- Focus comparisons on Port of Entry performance rather than regional geography

### Time Period Differences

**Why Different:**
- Connectivity Plan published in 2025 using 2023 trade data (most recent available at time of analysis)
- Border Crossings Guide published annually with most current year's data (2024)
- Major plans update every 3-5 years; operational guides update annually

**Impact on Data:**
- Absolute dollar values differ due to year-over-year growth
- Percentages and trends remain comparable
- 2023 to 2024 saw continued trade growth post-pandemic

**Resolution:**
- Always note the data year when citing statistics
- Focus on trends and percentages rather than absolute values when comparing
- Use year-over-year growth rates to estimate reconciliation

### Infrastructure Counting Methodology

**Why Different:**
- Connectivity Plan counts POEs or major gateway facilities (network planning perspective)
- Border Crossings Guide counts individual operational crossing points including separate bridge spans
- Different levels of granularity for different purposes

**Impact on Data:**
- "28 bridges" vs "34 operational border crossings"
- Both are correct from their respective perspectives
- Creates confusion without explanation

**Resolution:**
- Border Crossings Guide provides most accurate operational count (34)
- Connectivity Plan's count (28) may exclude some small crossings or count dual spans as one
- Use Border Crossings Guide for precise facility inventory
- Use Connectivity Plan for network-level analysis

### Trade Value vs. Tonnage

**Why Different:**
- Connectivity Plan emphasizes truck freight tonnage (tons) for capacity planning
- Border Crossings Guide emphasizes trade value (dollars) for economic impact
- Different metrics serve different analytical needs

**Impact on Data:**
- Cannot directly compare tonnage to dollar values
- High-value, low-weight commodities (electronics) vs. low-value, high-weight commodities (minerals)
- Different rankings of regions based on metric used

**Resolution:**
- Use tonnage for infrastructure capacity planning (Connectivity Plan)
- Use dollar values for economic impact analysis (Border Crossings Guide)
- Recognize that Laredo dominates by both metrics

---

## Conclusion

The Connectivity Plan Story Map and Border Crossings Guide Story Map are complementary resources that serve fundamentally different purposes. Rather than viewing their differences as discrepancies, they should be understood as intentional design choices:

- **Connectivity Plan**: Strategic, binational, long-range planning document analyzing **economic regions and transportation corridors** for transportation professionals and policymakers
- **Border Crossings Guide**: Operational data for **border crossings** providing both district aggregate totals and individual crossing performance data for the public and border managers

**Key Distinction:** The Connectivity Plan analyzes geographic regions for corridor planning; the Border Crossings Guide reports crossing operations grouped by TxDOT district. The Border Crossings Guide provides data at two levels: district totals (all crossings in El Paso, Laredo, or RGV) and individual crossing performance (each Port of Entry and bridge).

When used together, these documents provide:
1. Regional corridor planning context (Connectivity Plan) + District and crossing-level operational data (Border Crossings Guide)
2. Long-range infrastructure needs (2050 projections) + Current crossing performance (2024 data)
3. Binational economic analysis + U.S.-side crossing operations (district totals and individual crossings)
4. Corridor tonnage flows + Port of Entry trade values and district aggregate totals

**Recommendation:** Maintain both documents with their distinct focuses. Do NOT attempt to force geographic alignment between them. Instead:
- Link from Connectivity Plan regional analysis to relevant Border Crossings Guide Port of Entry pages
- Link from Border Crossings Guide crossing data to relevant Connectivity Plan corridor needs
- Create a brief guide explaining: "Use Connectivity Plan for corridor planning; use Border Crossings Guide for crossing selection and performance"
