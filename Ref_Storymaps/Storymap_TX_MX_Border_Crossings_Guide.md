**Title:** Connecting People and Goods Across the Texas-Mexico Border: A Guide to the State's Border Crossings

## Introduction

This interactive Story Map complements and updates the Texas-Mexico International Border Crossings Guide 2024 published by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT).

**Note: For the best browsing experience, view on a desktop device.**

This Story Map provides information about the importance of the Texas-Mexico border and the border crossings in three regions (El Paso, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley). It presents trade and crossing volume data at two levels: (1) district aggregate totals showing total trade and crossing volumes for each region, and (2) individual crossing details for each Port of Entry and bridge. The data covers trends in cross-border trade (by commercial truck and rail) and travel (by passenger vehicle, bus, and as a pedestrian/bicyclist) for the period 2014 to 2024, along with information on planned future international bridges and border crossings. 

**Note:  The pedestrian icons used in this Story Map represent both pedestrian and bicycle crossings.**

## Texas-Mexico Border

Texas shares a **1,254-mile land border** with **four Mexican states** (Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas), alongside a robust border infrastructure that facilitates and enhances the movement of people and goods through **34 operational border crossings** within **12 ports of entry** (i.e., a collection of international bridges, airports, and/or seaports organized by operations) in Texas. 

In Texas, border crossings are organized into **three regions:**

* El Paso Region,
* Laredo Region, and
* Rio Grande Valley Region.

### El Paso Region

The **El Paso region** includes border crossings in the El Paso District area. This section provides total trade and crossing volumes for the entire region, as well as individual crossing details for each Port of Entry.

Texas' El Paso region has four ports of entry that include 10 operational border crossings and two airports. Seven border crossings process pedestrians/bicyclists, seven process passenger vehicles, five process buses, four process commercial trucks, and two process railcars.

> **Embedded Interactive AGOL Map:** This section features an interactive map showing the El Paso region's border crossings and surrounding geography. The map displays border crossing locations with various icons representing different transportation modes and county boundaries.

### Laredo Region

The **Laredo region** includes border crossings in the Laredo District area. This section provides total trade and crossing volumes for the entire region, as well as individual crossing details for each Port of Entry.

## The Role of Texas' Border Infrastructure in U.S.-Mexico Trade and Cross-Border Travel

> **Embedded Data Visualization Carousel (Slides 1-2):** This section contains a multi-slide carousel showing visual data about trade and infrastructure.

Mexico is the U.S. and Texas' most important international trading partner. In 2024, the U.S. and Mexico traded $839.9 billion in goods, of which nearly two-thirds ($552.9 billion) were processed at the Texas border regions. **In the same year, Texas traded $281.2 billion in goods with Mexico: 3.7 times the value of Texas' trade with Canada, the State's second largest international trading partner.** 

In addition, $271.7 billion in trade originating in or destined for other U.S. States or Canada that passed through the state was processed at the Texas border regions. Of the $552.9 billion of U.S.-Mexico trade that was processed at the Texas border regions, $454.5 billion (82%) was transported by commercial truck and $88.8 billion (16%) was transported by rail.

### Northbound Pedestrian/Bicycle Crossings

Between 2014 and 2019, northbound pedestrian/bicycle crossings increased 23%. The sharp reduction in northbound pedestrian/bicycle crossings in 2020 and 2021 was due to COVID-19 and the closure of the international border crossings to non-essential travel (between March 2020 and November 2021). Since then, northbound pedestrian/bicycle crossings have increased, but have not reached the 2019 volume.

*Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)*

### Northbound Passenger Vehicle Crossings

Northbound passenger vehicle crossings at the Texas-Mexico border peaked in 2018 at 35.4 million. Although northbound passenger vehicle crossings have yet to return to the 2018 peak, overall northbound passenger vehicle crossings increased seven percent between 2014 and 2024.

*Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)*

### Northbound Bus Crossings

Northbound bus crossings at the Texas-Mexico border peaked in 2014 at 98,505. Northbound bus crossings were similarly impacted by the "non-essential travel" ban due to COVID-19. Overall, northbound bus crossings have declined 25% between 2014 and 2024.

## Presidential Permits

> **Embedded Image:** Photo showing border infrastructure related to presidential permits.

Since 2020, there were 10 Presidential Permits issued for international bridges along the Texas-Mexico Border. This section discusses Presidential Permits that were issued:

* for a recently completed international bridge (i.e., the Patrick J. Ottensmeyer International Railway Bridge),
* for an international bridge under construction (i.e., Pharr International Bridge),
* for the expansion of existing international bridges (i.e., Camino Real International Bridge, World Trade Bridge, and Colombia Solidarity Bridge), and
* for new international bridges (i.e., Puerto Verde Global Trade Bridge, Flor de Mayo Bridge, Laredo IV/V International Bridge, Green Corridors International Bridge, and Cameron County Gateway International Pedestrian Bridge Brownsville). 

### Recently Completed International Bridges

**Patrick J. Ottensmeyer International Railway Bridge**

On February 6, 2025 CPKC officially opened the second span of the Patrick J. Ottensmeyer International Railway Bridge that was completed on December 17, 2024. The $100 million bridge investment allows trains to operate in both directions simultaneously, thereby more than doubling the capacity to move rail freight across the Texas-Mexico border at Laredo.
