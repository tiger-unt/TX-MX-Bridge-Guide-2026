**Source:** [ArcGIS StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ac9bf9b365f842e29d7316dbbf282b2b)

## Introduction

The most recent **Texas-Mexico Border Transportation Master Plan (BTMP)** was published in March 2021. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) completed this effort in collaboration with various stakeholders and community members to develop a long-range plan for the Texas-Mexico border region that facilitates the efficient movement of people and goods.

The BTMP represents a significant effort to address the complex transportation needs of the border region, with the goal of enhancing economic vitality and global competitiveness for Texas and the broader North American market. The plan produced 22 policy recommendations, 153 programs, and 661 project recommendations for future consideration and implementation. One of the 22 policy recommendations of the BTMP was to “provide multimodal connectivity between border crossings to provide enhanced network redundancy for efficient border region trips.” The **Texas-Mexico Border Region Connectivity Plan** is a continuation of this policy recommendation and aims to identify needs and make recommendations to improve multimodal connectivity in the border regions.

This interactive Story Map supplements the Texas-Mexico Border Region Connectivity Plan published by TxDOT in 2025. It summarizes trade trends and transportation needs in the binational Texas-Mexico border region (defined as 100 miles north and south of the border), offering an overview of the transportation system, trade dynamics, key industries, major corridors for cross-border movement, the impact of recent natural disasters, and a look ahead at the region’s future.

### The Texas-Mexico Border Region: A Vital Economic Nexus

The Texas-Mexico border spans 1,254 miles, making it the longest international border between a U.S. state and another country in the continental United States (US). It represents approximately 64% of the total US-Mexico border length.

The Texas-Mexico border region encompasses an area extending approximately 100 miles on both sides of the border. This binational region is home to 13.6 million people distributed across 200 cities and towns in both Texas and Mexico.

On the Texas side alone, over 3 million residents make up over 22% of the border region’s 13.5 million people, while the remaining 10.5 million live on the Mexican side. [1]

The Texas border region can be divided into three subregions: West, Central, and South. Let’s take a deeper dive into each.

#### West Region
The West Texas border region includes over 900,000 residents—one-third of the Texas border population—while the Mexican side of this region in Chihuahua, has approximately 1.82 million people. [1]

The West Texas border region supported 311,000 jobs in 2021, with its GDP surging by 92% between 2017 and 2022 to reach $82.1 billion. [2]

Looking ahead to 2050, the West Texas region's trajectory suggests continued economic expansion, with employment projected to increase by 61% to 501,000 jobs. [3]

The latest 2021 estimates indicate that the Mexican side of the border region in Chihuahua accounted for 914,000 jobs—nearly 14% of total border-region employment. [2]

The map shows the Texas side (including El Paso County) and the Mexican state of Chihuahua highlighted in yellow. Markers represent TAZ employment data points. The map shows major highways (I-10, I-20) and city labels for spatial context.

#### Central Region
The Central Texas border region has over 300,000 residents—about 10% of the Texas border population—while the bordering area in Coahuila has approximately 1.055 million people. [1]

While the Central Texas border region may be the smallest of the three, it maintains a robust economy supporting 86,000 jobs and generating a GDP of $18.6 billion in 2022, which has grown by 32% over the previous five years. [2]

Looking forward to 2050, the region's employment is expected to grow by 48% to reach 127,000 jobs. [3]

The latest 2021 estimates indicate that the Mexican side of the border region in Coahuila accounted for 473,000 jobs or about 7% of total border-region employment. [2]

> **Interactive Map Visualization:** An ArcGIS-based map displays employment levels by Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) for the Central Region, showing the Texas border counties (Del Rio and Eagle Pass areas) and the Mexican state of Coahuila (highlighted in yellow). Markers indicate TAZ employment data points. The map shows the border crossing locations and major transportation corridors including US-90 and US-277.

#### South Region
The South Texas border region is the most populous on the Texas side, with over 1.8 million residents—about 60% of the state’s border population—while the border region in the adjacent Mexican states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas have approximately 5.67 million and 1.99 million people, respectively. [1]

The South Texas border region supported 578,000 jobs and had a GDP of $79.8 billion in 2022, which has grown 39% since 2017. [2]

The region's employment is projected to grow to 1,046,000 jobs in 2050. [3]

The latest 2021 estimates indicate that the Mexican side of the border region in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas accounted for a total of over 3.74 million jobs or about 57% of total border-region employment. [2]

> **Interactive Map Visualization:** An ArcGIS-based map displays employment levels by Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) for the South Region, showing the largest and most complex employment distribution of the three regions. The map highlights the Texas side (including Laredo/Webb County, McAllen/Hidalgo County, and Brownsville/Cameron County) and the Mexican states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. Dense clusters of markers indicate high employment concentration in metropolitan areas like Laredo, McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, and Brownsville-Harlingen, as well as Monterrey on the Mexican side. The map shows the extensive I-35 corridor and US-83 regional connections.

## Gateway Infrastructure

The 1,254-mile Texas-Mexico border, North America's busiest trade gateway, is vital to economic growth, with transportation infrastructure linking people, businesses, and goods via crossings, airports, ports, rail, and pipelines.

The three border regions in Texas and Mexico are supported by:
*   **28** International bridges and border crossings
*   **18** Crossings equipped to handle trucks
*   **4** Freight rail crossings currently in operations
*   **8** Commercial airports
*   **2** Deep draft ports
*   **3** Shallow draft ports

Together, these facilities form a comprehensive network supporting international trade and regional mobility.

## Trade Dynamics

In 2023, $207 billion in goods moved southbound from the Texas border region to Mexico, with leading exports being high-tech, machinery, chemicals and motor vehicle products. Meanwhile, $261 billion in goods moved northbound across the border into the Texas border region, with leading exports being high-tech, motor vehicles, machinery, and chemical products.

Truck transportation is the dominant mode for cross-border trade between Texas and Mexico, consistently carrying around 80% of the total goods value since 2019. Trucks play a key role in moving high-value, technology-related goods, while rail is essential for transporting large, bulky commodities. Although less prominent in volume, air, pipeline, and maritime modes are crucial for moving goods that support the economic vitality of both countries.

> **Data Visualization - Stacked Horizontal Bar Chart:** "Goods by Commodity Moving Northbound and Southbound (In Billions $, 2023)" displays two horizontal bars comparing northbound ($261B from Mexico to Texas) and southbound ($207B from Texas to Mexico) trade. Each bar is segmented by commodity types using distinct colors: High Tech (dark teal), Motor Vehicles (blue), Machinery (medium blue), Chemicals (yellow), Metal Products (orange), Plastics and Rubber (tan), Manufactured Goods (pink), Vegetable Products (light green), Foodstuffs (beige), Textiles (brown), Animal Products (cream), Wood Products (light yellow), and Mineral Products (red). The chart clearly shows High Tech and Motor Vehicles dominate both directional flows. Created with Datawrapper, sourced from Bureau of Transportation Statistics BTS Transborder Data.

> **Data Visualization - Horizontal Bar Chart:** "Cross-Border Commodity Flow Value by Texas Border Regions (in Billions $, 2019-2023)" compares commodity flows across three regions using horizontal bars. Each commodity type (Electrical Products, Industrial Machinery, Vehicles Other than Railway, Plastics and Articles, Measuring and Testing Instruments, Mineral Fuels/Oil and Waxes, Articles of Iron or Steel, Furniture/Prefabricated Buildings, All other) shows three bars representing Trade (red), Rail (blue), Maritime (orange), Air (light gray), and Other (dark gray) modes. The chart uses paired bars to show northbound (left bar) and southbound (right bar) flows with dollar values labeled. Electrical Products shows the highest total flows at $97.72B combined. Data sourced from BTS Transborder Data, visualization created with Datawrapper.

> **Interactive ArcGIS Map Visualization:** Trade flow map displays the entire Texas-Mexico border with curved flow lines emanating from each Port of Entry (POE). Blue lines represent northbound traffic (Mexico to Texas) while red lines represent southbound traffic (Texas to Mexico). Line thickness corresponds to trade volume, with the thickest lines at Port of Laredo indicating its dominant role ($261.9B). The map includes POE markers (Ysleta, El Paso, Presidio, Tornillo, Eagle Pass, Del Rio, Laredo, Roma, Rio Grande City, Progreso, Hidalgo, and Brownsville) showing trade statistics. The map includes geographic context with state boundaries and major cities.

On this map, trade flows through the regional Ports of Entry* are illustrated with blue lines representing northbound traffic and red lines indicating southbound traffic. [4]

*\*A Port of Entry (POE) serves as an official border crossing facility and legal entry point. Each land-based POE may consist of one or several crossing bridges. For visualization purposes, this map displays each POE at the location of its largest bridge. However, it's important to note that actual trade flows may be distributed across multiple crossing points within each POE's jurisdiction.*

### West Region
In 2023, the Western region's border trade flows totaled $96 billion, dominated by the **Ysleta Bridge at the Ysleta POE** with $73.4 billion in commerce.

Ysleta POE saw higher northbound traffic ($47.6 billion) than southbound ($25.8 billion), while the **Port of El Paso** showed the opposite pattern with $14.5 billion flowing south versus $7.0 billion north.

The smaller ports of **Tornillo** and **Presidio** each handled under $1 billion of commodity flows.

### Central Region
This region processed $42.7 billion in trade with Mexico in 2023.

The **Port of Eagle Pass** led with $37 billion in total bidirectional flows, showing higher northbound traffic ($25.5 billion) than southbound ($11.5 billion).

The Del Rio International Bridge at the **Port of Del Rio** handled the remaining $5.7 billion, maintaining a similar pattern of higher northbound flows.

### South Region
In 2023, the **Port of Laredo** dominated Texas's southern border trade with $261.9 billion, contributing to the region's total cross-border commerce of $329 billion—surpassing the combined value of all other Texas-Mexico border crossings.

Beyond Laredo, the **Port of Hidalgo** handled $44.5 billion in trade flows and the **Port of Brownsville** processed $21.1 billion in 2023.

A network of smaller crossings at the ports of **Roma**, **Rio Grande**, and **Progreso** complemented these major ports.

### Region-to-Region Connections

> **Interactive Sankey/Flow Diagram:** This visualization illustrates truck freight movement patterns in the border region using a Sankey-style flow diagram. The diagram shows five origin/destination nodes: West Region, Central Region, South Region, Rest of Texas, Rest of U.S., and Mexico. Curved flow bands connect these nodes, with band thickness proportional to tonnage volume. Major flows include: South Region to Rest of Texas (15.9M tons), Central Region to Rest of Texas (9.7M tons), South Region to Mexico (8.8M tons), and various inter-regional connections. The diagram visualizes that the South Region serves as the primary gateway, handling the largest volumes.

This flow chart illustrates the movement of truck freight in the border region in 2022, specifically focusing on shipments that either begin or end within the region. The analysis excludes any freight traffic that passes through the border region without stopping.

**Outbound Flow Dominance by Tonnage:**
In 2022, the border region processed 51.6 million tons of outbound truck freight flows (45% of total truck freight flows), compared to 26.8 million tons of inbound truck freight flows (24% of total truck freight flows). The areas in Texas outside of the border region are (Rest of Texas) the primary destination, receiving 54% of outbound truck freight flows, while Mexico receives 21.5%. [5]

**Regional Gateway Functions:**
The Southern region handled the largest truck freight volumes, with significant flows to Mexico (8.8 million tons) and Rest of Texas (15.9 million tons). The Western region served as a secondary gateway, moving 4.6 million tons of commodities by truck to the Rest of U.S. and 2.2 million tons to Rest of Texas, demonstrating its focus on domestic distribution. The Central region also showed notable connections with the Rest of Texas (9.7 million tons). [5]

**Region-to-Region Movement Characteristics:**
Internal truck freight flows accounted for over 35 million tons (31%) of total truck freight movements within the Texas-Mexico Border Region. When examining specific Region-to-Region connections, the strongest freight links by truck exist between the Central and Southern regions. However, these inter-regional flows are relatively small compared to the truck freight flows moving to and from external destinations. [5]

#### County-Level Truck Freight Flow Patterns

> **Interactive Flow Visualization - Two-Panel Display:**
> 
> **Left Panel - Horizontal Bar Chart:** "Top 10 County-to-County Freight Flows within Border Region (2022)" displays the top 10 directional county pairs ranked by tonnage. Each bar shows the flow direction (e.g., "Webb to El Paso") with tonnage values labeled. The top flow, Webb County to El Paso County, shows 203,422 tons (14.2% of total). The bars use a teal color scheme, with percentages indicating share of all county-to-county flows. This chart makes Webb County's (Laredo) critical distribution role immediately visible, as it appears as the origin in 4 of the top 10 flows.
> 
> **Right Panel - Interactive ArcGIS Map:** The map visualizes the same top 10 county flows using curved lines overlaid on the Texas border region. Line thickness corresponds to freight volume, with the thickest line connecting Webb County (Laredo) to El Paso County. County boundaries are shown with labels for key counties (Webb, El Paso, Hidalgo, Medina, Uvalde, Atascosa, etc.). The map shows the geographic distribution of these flows, with most connecting the South and Central regions to the West region or to counties near San Antonio. The background includes major highways and city labels for spatial context.

This section dives deeper into key border region county-level truck freight flow patterns. This analysis uses 2022 Transearch estimates of truck freight flows, specifically examining movements within the Texas-Mexico Border Region. The analysis focuses on trips that both begin and end within the border region*, excluding flows that either originate from or terminate outside the region, as well as pass-through traffic.

*\*Note that the border region includes certain San Antonio suburban counties like Medina in the Central Region but excludes Bexar County. After identifying the top 20 county pairs with the highest directional flow tonnage, the top 10 pairs, which represent 63% of all county-to-county flows in the border region (excluding internal county flows), were visualized in the graph on the left. This visualization therefore highlights the most significant intercounty freight movements within the Texas-Mexico Border Region rather than providing a comprehensive view of all commodity flows in the area.*

**Webb County's Critical Role**
Webb County, home to Laredo in the Southern border region, is a major origin for truck commodity flows, featuring in 4 of the top 10 regional county pairs with the highest flows. In 2022, its largest flow was to El Paso County, home to El Paso in the Western border region, totaling 203,422 tons and accounting for over 14% of all Texas county-to-county commodity flows. [5]

Other significant county-to-county flows in 2022 include Webb County to Medina County (west of San Antonio in the Central border region) with 156,693 tons, representing about 11% of Texas’s total county-to-county flows. Webb County also had substantial two-way trade with Uvalde County (between Del Rio and San Antonio), with 88,034 tons flowing to Uvalde and 95,277 tons returning to Webb. [5]

**Central-South Regional Connections**
The data shows multiple active truck freight connections between Central and South region counties:
*   Goods movement from Medina County (west of San Antonio in the Central border region) to Hidalgo County (home to McAllen in the Southern border region) totaled 107,900 tons in 2022, accounting for 7.5% of all Texas county-to-county commodity flows. [5]
*   Goods movement from Medina County to Atascosa County (south of San Antonio in the Southern border region) totaled 77,740 tons in 2022, representing 5.4% of all Texas county-to-county commodity flows. [5]
*   There are also multiple smaller flows between other Central-South Texas county pairs. [5]

**South Region's Substantial Internal Freight Flows**
South Texas region counties demonstrate comparatively high internal freight movements, with Hidalgo County leading at 13.2 million tons of internal flows, Webb County handling 3.9 million tons within its boundaries, followed by Cameron County at 2.7 million tons of internal flows. [5]

This indicates that while Webb County (Laredo) serves as a key hub for inter-county freight distribution, Hidalgo County (McAllen area) and Cameron County (Brownsville area) have established more extensive internal freight networks. This suggests a larger local manufacturing and distribution ecosystem of these two counties, driving significant intra-county goods movement. [5]

## Key Industries

This section highlights key manufacturing sectors that underscore the strong economic ties and integrated supply chains between Texas and Mexico. The analysis provides insights into trade flows, supply chain networks, and the importance of transportation infrastructure for facilitating the movement of goods. These industries reflect the border region’s position as a vital hub for North American trade.

### High-Tech Manufacturing

The high-tech products supply chain includes the design and manufacturing of electrical products, transportation equipment (including railway equipment, traffic signalizing equipment, aircraft, and ships), and measuring and testing instruments. The high-tech products industry in Mexico has firmly established itself as a significant global player with strong connections to the U.S.

Approximately $121 billion of high-tech products moved across the Texas-Mexico border in 2023, with 60% going northbound from Mexico to Texas and 40% going southbound from Texas to Mexico. [6]

**Pandemic Impact, Recovery, and Growth**
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the northbound trade of high-tech products saw a more pronounced drop during April and May 2020 compared to the southbound flows from Texas to Mexico.

However, these northbound flows rebounded more quickly, returning to pre-pandemic levels by August 2020. In contrast, the southbound flows took until March 2021 to fully recover.

Following this recovery, the trade values for high-tech products traveling in both directions increased by approximately 24% by the end of 2023. [7]

**Use of Infrastructure**
The largest share of high-tech manufacturing goods movements travel through the POEs in South (64%, led by the **Laredo Port of Entry**) and West (32%, led by the **Ysleta Port of Entry**) regions. [6]

> **Static Highway Infrastructure Map:** This map displays high-tech industry truck freight utilization across the Texas-Mexico border region highway network. Major highways are color-coded by freight intensity: darker/thicker lines indicate higher volumes of high-tech product movements, while lighter/thinner lines show lower volumes. The map clearly highlights several key corridors: **I-10** appears as the dominant east-west artery running from El Paso through the West and Central regions with heavy line weight; **I-35** shows as a major north-south corridor through the South Region connecting Laredo to San Antonio; **I-20**, **US-285**, **US-90**, and **US-83** are also prominently displayed. The map includes all three border regions with state boundaries, major cities, and POE locations marked. A legend indicates freight volume categories, and the map shows flows for all shipments (starting in region, ending in region, or passing through).

This map shows how the sector utilizes highway infrastructure for all truck freight flows, including shipments that start in the region, end in the region, or pass through the region. [6]

*   In the **West Region**, **I-10** stands out as the key artery for high-tech product movements. **I-20** and **US-285** also facilitate high volume of high-tech product movements to the north and south of I-10.
*   In the **Central Region**, **I-10** continues to be the dominant corridor. In addition, **US-90** along the border region is another key corridor for high-tech product movement.
*   In the **South Region**, major north-south flows of high-tech products are facilitated by **I-35**, and supported by **I-37**, and **US-281**; while major east-west flows are carried on **US-83** connecting Eagle Pass, Laredo, and Brownsville and **US-57** between Eagle Pass and San Antonio.

Between 2022 and 2050, I-10 and I-35 are projected to absorb most of the growth in commodity volume projected for this sector. I-20 north of I-10, US-90 between I-10 and Eagle Pass, and US-83 between Eagle Pass and I-35 are also projected to have a considerable share of the growth in moving motor-vehicle manufactured goods. [8]

**Geographic Distribution of High-Tech Trade via Texas Border**

> **Interactive Choropleth Map - Dual Geographic View:** This visualization uses two side-by-side maps showing the geographic distribution of high-tech products crossing the Texas-Mexico border:
> 
> **Left Map - U.S. States:** Displays U.S. states shaded by high-tech freight volume intensity, with darker shades indicating higher volumes. Texas appears in the darkest shade, followed by Georgia, Michigan, and California in medium-dark shades. Other states show varying lighter intensities.
> 
> **Right Map - Mexican States:** Shows Mexican states similarly color-coded by freight volume. Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and the Mexico City region (Estado de México) appear in darker shades, indicating they are the primary origins/destinations for high-tech products crossing via Texas. The map highlights the concentration of high-tech manufacturing in northern Mexican border states.
> 
> Both maps include state boundaries, labels, and interactive tooltips. A shared legend shows the volume categories using a gradient color scale. The maps effectively visualize the binational supply chain network for high-tech products.

The interactive map* displays how high-tech industry truck freight moves across the Texas-Mexico border region. [5] It captures three types of shipments: those starting in the border region, those ending in the border region, and those entering through border POEs while passing through the region.

High-tech products crossing the border via Texas by trucks are primarily originated from/destined to Texas, followed by Georgia, Michigan, and California.

Meanwhile, in Mexico, high-tech products crossing the Texas-Mexico border primarily move to and from the states of Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Mexico City.

### Motor Vehicles Manufacturing

The motor vehicle manufacturing industry in North America is highly integrated, with parts and components frequently crossing borders multiple times during the manufacturing process. Parts might be manufactured in one country, assembled into larger components in another, and finally assembled into complete vehicles elsewhere. The final assembly and production of parts in Mexico contributes to the competitiveness of American and Canadian vehicles in the global market.

Approximately $82 billion of motor vehicles moved across the Texas-Mexico border in 2023, with $23.6 billion southbound flow from Texas to Mexico and $58.8 billion northbound flow from Mexico to Texas. [6]

**Pandemic Impact, Recovery, and Growth**
The motor vehicle industry saw a pronounced decline in northbound trade flows from Mexico to the border region at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the sharpest decrease during April and May 2020.

As of December 2023, northbound flows have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, experiencing a 15% decrease in total flows by the end of 2023 compared to 2019.

In contrast, southbound flows from the border region to Mexico have shown a robust increase, growing approximately 39% in value since 2019. [7]

**Use of Infrastructure**
The largest share of movements travels through the POEs in the South Texas region (65%, led by the **Laredo Port of Entry**), followed by Central (22% led by the **Eagle Pass Port of Entry**) and West (12%, led by the Ysleta and **El Paso** Ports of Entry) regions. [6]

> **Static Highway Infrastructure Map:** Similar to the high-tech map but color-coded for motor vehicle industry freight flows. The map displays highway segments with varying line weights and colors representing freight intensity levels. Key corridors prominently displayed include: **I-10** (dominant east-west), **I-35** (major north-south through Laredo), **US-90** (along the border), **US-83** (connecting Eagle Pass, Laredo, and Brownsville), and **TX-359** (between Laredo and Hebbronville). The South Region corridors show notably heavier line weights reflecting the 65% share through this region. The map covers the entire Texas-Mexico border region with city labels, POE locations, and state boundaries for geographic reference.

This map shows how the sector utilizes highway infrastructure for all truck freight flows, including shipments that start in the region, end in the region, or pass through the region. [5]

*   In the **West Region**, **I-10** stands out as the key artery for motor-vehicle industry goods movement. **I-20** and **US-285** also facilitate high volume of motor-vehicle industry movements to the north and south of I-10.
*   In the **Central Region**, **I-10** continues to be the dominant corridor. In addition, **US-90** along the border region is another key corridor for motor-vehicle industry movements.
*   In the **South Region**, motor-vehicle industry movements are primarily facilitated by **I-35**, for north-south flows, while east-west flows are dominated by **US-83**, connecting Eagle Pass, Laredo, and Brownsville, and **TX-359** between Laredo and Hebbronville.

Between 2022 and 2050, I-10, I-35, and US-90 are expected to handle the majority of growth in motor vehicle commodity volumes. I-20 north of I-10 and US-83 between Eagle Pass and I-35 are also projected to absorb a significant share of this growth. [8]

**Geographic Distribution of Motor-Vehicle Industry Trade via Texas Border**

> **Interactive Choropleth Map - Dual Geographic View:** Similar format to the high-tech maps but showing motor vehicle industry distribution:
> 
> **Left Map - U.S. States:** Texas and Michigan appear in the darkest shades, reflecting their roles as major motor vehicle production and trade centers. California, Georgia, and Ohio show medium-dark intensities. The visualization clearly illustrates the importance of the Texas-Mexico-Michigan automotive supply chain corridor.
> 
> **Right Map - Mexican States:** Coahuila and Nuevo León appear in the darkest shades, highlighting these states' concentration of automotive manufacturing (including production centers in Ramos Arizpe Saltillo and Monterrey). Mexico City region (Estado de México) also shows high intensity. The map demonstrates how automotive production clusters near the border facilitate efficient cross-border trade.
> 
> The shared color scale legend enables direct comparison between U.S. and Mexican state volumes. State boundaries and labels provide geographic context.

The interactive map* illustrates motor-vehicle industry truck movements across the Texas-Mexico border region. [5] It captures three types of shipments: those starting in the border region, those ending in the border region, and those entering through border POEs while passing through the region.

In the U.S., cross-border motor vehicle industry goods movements by trucks primarily move to and from Texas and Michigan, followed by California, Georgia, and Ohio.

In Mexico, motor vehicles products originate from and transport to states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Mexico City. Major cities of production include Ramos Arizpe Saltillo (Coahuila), Monterrey (Nuevo Leon), and Mexico City.

### Industrial Machinery Manufacturing

The Texas-Mexico machinery supply chain exemplifies a well-integrated cross-border trade system, characterized by the movement of component parts such as engines and pumps from the U.S. to Mexico, where they are used in manufacturing processes. Finished products, including complex machinery and household appliances, are then transported northbound back to the U.S.

Approximately $97 billion of industrial machineries moved across the Texas-Mexico border in 2023. [6]

**Pandemic Impact, Recovery, and Growth**
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade in industrial machinery, both northbound and southbound, experienced significant declines during April and May 2020.

Following a period of recovery and subsequent growth, by 2023, the northbound flows from Mexico to the border region had returned to levels nearly equivalent to those of 2019. Meanwhile, the southbound flow of industrial machinery from Texas to Mexico recorded a modest increase of 14% between 2019 and 2023. [7]

**Use of Infrastructure**
The largest share of industrial machinery movements travels through the POEs in South (67%, led by the **Laredo Port of Entry**) and West (29%, led by the **Ysleta Port of Entry**) regions. [6]

> **Static Highway Infrastructure Map:** Color-coded for industrial machinery freight flows showing highway segment utilization. The map uses graduated line weights and colors to represent freight intensity. Major corridors prominently featured include: **I-10** (heavy east-west corridor), **I-35** (major north-south through South Region), **I-37** (from Corpus Christi area), **US-281** (Rio Grande Valley connections), **US-83** (between Eagle Pass and Laredo), **I-20** (north of I-10), and **US-285** (north-south in West Region). The heavier line weights in the South Region corridors reflect the 67% share through this region's POEs. Geographic context includes city labels, POE locations, state boundaries, and major transportation nodes.

This map shows how the sector utilizes highway infrastructure for all truck flows, including shipments that start in the region, end in the region, or pass through the region. [5]

*   In the **West Region**, **I-10** stands out as the key artery for industrial machinery goods movement. **I-20** and **US-285** also facilitate high volume of industrial machinery goods movements to the north and south of I-10.
*   In the **Central Region**, **I-10** continues to be the dominant corridor. In addition, **US-90** along the border region is another key corridor for industrial machinery goods movement.
*   In the **South Region**, major north-south flows of industrial machinery goods movements are facilitated by **I-35**, **I-37**, and **US-281**, while major east-west flows are carried on **US-83** between Eagle Pass and Laredo.

Between 2022 and 2050, I-10 and I-35 are projected to absorb most of the growth in commodity flow projected for this sector. I-20 north of I-10 and US-90 between I-10 and Eagle Pass are also projected to gain a considerable share of the growth in the industrial machinery industry goods movement. [8]

> 
> **Left Map - U.S. States:** Texas appears in the darkest shade as the primary state for industrial machinery crossing the border. Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee, and California show medium-dark to medium shading, indicating significant industrial machinery trade with Mexico through Texas border crossings. The geographic spread illustrates the Midwest's industrial manufacturing connection to Mexican production facilities.
> 
> **Right Map - Mexican States:** Nuevo León and Coahuila appear in the darkest shades, showing their dominance in industrial machinery trade via Texas. These states house major manufacturing and distribution centers that rely on Texas border crossings for industrial equipment and components. Other border states show lighter intensities.
> 
> The shared gradient legend enables volume comparison across both countries. State labels and boundaries provide geographic context for understanding trade patterns.

The interactive map* displays how industrial machinery industry truck freight moves across the Texas-Mexico border region. [5] It captures three types of shipments: those starting in the border region, those ending in the border region, and those entering through border POEs while passing through the region.

Industrial machineries crossing the border via Texas by trucks are primarily originated from/destined to Texas, followed by Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee, and California.

Meanwhile, in Mexico, industrial machineries crossing the Texas-Mexico border primarily move to and from Nuevo Leon and Coahuila.

## Key Corridors

The Texas-Mexico border region's robust freight movement is supported by an extensive infrastructure network that includes both the gateway nodes discussed in the Gateway Infrastructure section and the Regional Border Connectivity Network (RBCN) shown on the map.

The RBCN was identified as the basis for measuring current and future conditions in the border region. From this network, a subset focusing on non-interstate highways and corridor segments outside urban areas is used for a detailed needs assessment and corridor scoring. This subset targets issues that TxDOT can address in coordination with its local and regional partners.

In this section, we present two complementary analyses of the RBCN:
*   A detailed commodity flow analysis focusing on two major corridors
*   A comprehensive needs assessment of the RBCN using key performance metrics measuring safety, mobility, reliability, and connectivity

### Key Corridors Snapshot
Let's begin by examining commodity flows along:
*   Interstate 10 (I-10), which runs east-west through both the Western and Central Regions
*   U.S. Highway 83 (US-83), which serves as a primary north-south artery linking the Central and Southern Regions.

The analysis examines truck freight movements on these corridors that either originate in or are destined for the border region (not including pass-through traffic), encompassing both cross-border and domestic flows.

#### Interstate 10
I-10 is a critical east-west corridor in the Texas border region, stretching approximately 580 miles from El Paso in the Western Region to San Antonio, east of the Central Region. This predominantly four-lane highway facilitates significant freight movements originating from or destined for the border region. In 2022, it transported an average of 21.2 million tons of commodities valued at $51.8 billion annually. [8]

By 2050, commodities originating from or destined for the border region that are carried by I-10 (excluding pass-through flows) are projected to increase to an average of 33.5 million tons annually, valued at $107.4 billion. [8]

> **Interactive Line Chart with Geographic Context:** This visualization combines a line chart showing monthly commodity flow seasonality with a map context panel:
> 
> **Line Chart (main display):** Shows monthly variation in cross-border commodity flows on I-10 throughout 2022. Multiple lines represent different commodity categories (Motor Vehicles, Manufactured Goods, Foodstuffs, Vegetable Products, etc.). The y-axis shows tonnage, and the x-axis shows months (Jan-Dec). A prominent spike appears in March across multiple commodity types. The Vegetable Products line shows the most dramatic seasonality with January peaks (28% above average) and July lows (27% below average), creating a characteristic winter-high/summer-low pattern.
> 
> **Map Panel:** Displays I-10's route across the border region from El Paso to San Antonio, with the corridor highlighted. POE locations along or near the route are marked, showing the connection between border crossings and the corridor.

Diving into the seasonality of cross-border truck commodity flows carried on I-10, this map shows a synchronized increase in commodity volume in March. [9]

This increase occurs across multiple manufacturing commodities, with Motor Vehicles rising 26% above average, and manufactured goods industry showing 12% increase above average in March 2022. [9]

In 2022, cross-border foodstuff products saw the lowest commodity flow volume in January (21% below average) and peak in August (13.5% above average). [9] This relatively stable pattern indicates the movement of cross-border goods in the processed food distribution industry that rely heavily on the I-10 corridor align with retail cycles rather than agricultural seasons.

In reference to agricultural seasons, Vegetable Products dominate the cross-border commodity movement on the corridor, with both the highest volume and the most dramatic seasonal swings. Average volumes are 106,569 tons, with fluctuations of up to 75% between peak and lowest months. Winter peaks in January (28% above average) and summer lows in July (27% below average) reflect I-10's vital role in transporting Mexican winter harvests eastward. [9]

This diverse mix of cross-border commodity flows creates an efficient year-round utilization of the I-10 corridor. While agricultural movements decrease during summer months, industrial commodities maintain strong flows during this period, ensuring consistent corridor usage throughout the year.

#### US Highway 83
US-83 is a critical north-south corridor in the Texas border region, stretching approximately 265 miles from Uvalde in the Central Region to McAllen, in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, in the Southern Region. This predominantly two-lane road facilitates significant freight movements that were originated from or destined to the border region. It transported 6.4 million tons of commodities valued at $15.4 billion dollars on average annually in 2022. [8]

By 2050, commodities originating from or destined for the border region that are carried by US-83 (excluding pass-through flows) are projected to increase to an average of 11.4 million tons annually, valued at $35.2 billion. [8]

> **Interactive Line Chart with Geographic Context:** Similar format to the I-10 visualization but for US-83:
> 
> **Line Chart (main display):** Shows monthly seasonality patterns for cross-border commodity flows on US-83 throughout 2022. Multiple lines track different commodity categories across the twelve months. The March manufacturing spike is visible, similar to I-10. The Vegetable Products line shows the most extreme seasonality variation, with January and March peaks around 35,000 tons and July-August lows around 20,000 tons (a 72% difference), reflecting the Rio Grande Valley's winter growing season. The Foodstuffs line (showing ~67,800 tons average) displays relatively steady flow throughout the year with less dramatic variation.
> 
> **Map Panel:** Displays US-83's north-south route from Uvalde through the Central Region to McAllen in the South Region. The corridor is highlighted with POE locations marked along the route (Eagle Pass, Laredo, Rio Grande City, Roma, and Hidalgo/McAllen crossings), illustrating how this corridor connects multiple border crossing points.

Diving into the seasonality of cross-border commodity flows carried on US-83, similar to I-10, US-83 also sees an increase in freight activities in March, led by manufacturing industries. [9]

Cross-border Vegetable Products show the most dramatic seasonal swings on US-83. The lowest months (July and August) see only around 20,000 tons crossing the border on average while the peak months (January and March) reach 35,000 tons - a 72% difference. [9] This pattern clearly follows the Rio Grande Valley's winter growing season, with January seeing the highest volumes and July the lowest.

The corridor's largest cross-border commodity flows were led by the Foodstuffs industry, which maintained relatively steady flows throughout the year (average of 67,800 tons). [9] This shows that the US-83 corridor serves both year-round food supply chains and seasonal farm-to-market movements.

### Network-Wide Needs Assessment Findings

## Building Preparedness and Business Continuity

Trade along the Texas-Mexico border has grown significantly over the past two decades, making the cross-border infrastructure network critical to national economic security. Any disruption or damage to this network could severely impact trade flows essential to the livelihoods and quality of life for millions, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Border Region Bouncing Back Post-Pandemic

During the pandemic, all regions experienced a drop in trade value, with the South Texas Region experiencing the largest drop at $43 billion, followed by the West Region at $8 billion and the Central Region at $4 billion between 2019 and 2020. [10]

Trade across all regions demonstrated resilience and recovery post-pandemic, with each surpassing 2019 levels by 2023. The South Region rebounded strongly, adding $66 billion in 2021, followed by the West Region with $16 billion and the Central Region with $8 billion. [7]

### Extreme Weather Events

Disruptive incidents from extreme weather events have repeatedly interrupted cross-border trade and supply chain operations, leading to economic losses and delays.

The border region has experienced a concerning uptick in extreme weather events in recent years, from hurricanes and tropical storms to winter freezes and powerful thunderstorms.

**Hurricane Hanna, July 2020**
Hurricane Hanna caused widespread damage in Southeast Texas and caused power outages in Brownsville. As a result, the Port of Brownsville was closed briefly. [11]

**Hurricane Laura, August 2020**
Hurricane Laura made landfall in Louisiana and affected the middle and northern Gulf Coast of Texas. All of the commercial ports and shipping channels closest to the storm's landfall were closed. Port Arthur experienced significant disruption due to mandatory evacuations and temporary closure. [12]

**Tropical Storm Beta, September 2020**
Tropical Storm Beta caused significant flooding in the Houston and Galveston areas. Port of Houston temporarily suspended operations due to high water levels. [13]

**Hurricane Nicholas, September 2021**
Hurricane Nicholas caused 100,000 people in the Houston and Galveston areas to go without power for several days. [14]

**Winter Storm, December 2022**
This winter storm brought freezing temperatures, ice, and snow to much of the state, affecting both coastal and inland ports. El Paso POEs experienced significant delays due to icy conditions. [15]

**Tropical Depression Harold, August 2023**
Tropical Depression Harold caused 20,000 people in Southern Texas to go without power for several days. Eagle Pass POE experienced some delays due to heavy rainfall. [16]

### Bolster Preparedness for Emerging Weather Challenges

Failing to adequately prepare the border region for these growing weather-related risks can lead to prolonged supply chain bottlenecks, damaged facilities, and other broader economic impacts. To reduce these vulnerabilities, key stakeholders must prioritize comprehensive business continuity planning and targeted infrastructure investments.

**Adaptation to Temperature Changes**
Projections indicate Texas will experience **a steady increase in average temperatures** in the coming decades, leading to more extreme heat conditions.

Extreme heat and cold conditions impact physical infrastructure conditions, material standards, and the need for frequent maintenance. While extreme cold events are expected to become less frequent, they will still pose occasional risks that require ongoing preparedness.

Border stakeholders must expand their implementation of measures to mitigate the impacts of extreme heat, such as enhancing cooling systems and worker safety protocols. Even as the threat of severe cold diminishes, **maintaining some cold weather readiness** remains prudent.

**Precipitation and Flood Risk Management**
Shifting weather patterns are projected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events in the border region, elevating the risk of damaging floods at border crossings, transportation hubs, and other critical infrastructure.

Prolonged flooding events may also result in costly infrastructure repairs and extended service interruptions.

Developing robust emergency response protocols and upgrading drainage systems, flood mitigation measures, and early warning capabilities will be essential to prepare for this growing threat.

**Sea Level Rise and Storm Surge Preparedness**
Failure to prepare for growing coastal flooding threats risks the inundation and damage of key border facilities, leading to disruptions that can reverberate across regional and national supply chains.

Coastal communities in the border region, such as Corpus Christi and Galveston, face escalating risks from rising sea levels and the associated threat of storm surge. Projections indicate a doubling of storm surge risk by 2050 due to the elevated baseline created by sea level rise.

Stakeholders must thoroughly assess the vulnerability of critical border infrastructure and assets in these high-risk areas. Investments in protective measures, including seawalls, flood barriers, and facility hardening, will be necessary to safeguard operations against the impacts of sea level rise and storm surge.

**Transportation-Related Emissions**
Transportation activities in the Texas-Mexico border region generate emissions that impact the region’s air quality. Efforts made throughout Texas in recent decades have helped the state make huge strides in its overall air quality. For example, ozone concentrations in Texas decreased by 32 percent from 2000 to 2020.

In the Texas-Mexico Border Region, only one county in Texas – El Paso – has had violations of the National Ambient Air Quality standards.

El Paso shares an air basin with Ciudad Juarez in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. To address air quality challenges in the shared air basin, formal cooperation takes place through the Joint Advisory Committee for the Improvement of Air Quality in the Paso del Norte. This binational group is the only one of its kind along the U.S.-Mexico border and conducts work with others to improve air quality in the Texas-Mexico Border Region, including academic and research organizations and all levels of government.

## Future Outlook

Looking ahead to 2050, Texas border communities are expected to continue to grow. Population projections indicate a 6% increase across the Texas border region, adding 200,000 new residents by 2050. This growth will likely concentrate around urban centers like El Paso, McAllen-Brownsville, and along the I-35 corridor connecting Laredo to San Antonio. [3]

Job growth is also expected across the border regions, with the South and West regions leading the biggest increase. While metropolitan areas continue to generate steady employment opportunities, growth is also anticipated in all communities along the I-35 corridor between Laredo and San Antonio. The Permian Basin's energy sector is expected to further fuel job creation throughout the West Region's rural communities. [3]

**Projected Growth in Border Region Commodity Flows:**
Total truck freight movements in the border region are expected to grow from 113.5 million tons in 2022 to 170.6 million tons in 2050, representing a 50% increase in commodity volume. [8]

The South region remains the largest gateway for truck freight movements, with volumes projected to increase from 71.2 million tons to 106.5 million tons from 2022 to 2050. [8]

The strongest commodity flow connection by truck tonnage continues to be between the Central and South regions.

In the distribution of flows, outbound truck freight movement share is projected to increase from 45% of total flows in 2022 to 48% of total flows in 2050, while internal truck freight flow share is projected to decrease from 31% of total flows in 2022 to 24% of total volume in 2050. [8]

Maps in this section illustrate how the projected growth in cross-border truck trade will impact Texas-Mexico highway networks from 2022 to 2050.

In the West Region, I-10 is projected to carry the biggest share in tonnage and value growth from cross-border commodity flows. US-90 and US-285 are also projected to facilitate the growth in commodity flows. [8]

In the Central Region, I-10 continues to be the dominant corridor absorbing the most growth in commodity flow tonnage and value. In addition, US-90 along the border region is another key corridor where additional cross-border commodity flows are projected to travel. [8]

In the South Region, I-35 is projected to carry a high share of commodity flow volume and value growth while other corridors, including I-37 and US-281, also contribute in absorbing the projected increase in commodity flow. [8]

### From Needs to Solutions

TxDOT identified unmet transportation needs along the Texas-Mexico border by comparing high-priority needs with currently planned and funded improvements in the region. When significant needs existed without programmed improvements, TxDOT classified these gaps as unmet needs requiring attention.

Through this technical analysis and stakeholder input, a comprehensive set of policy, program, and project recommendations emerged to address the unmet needs in three focus areas: First and Last Mile connectivity, Port-to-Port connectivity, and Region-to-Region improvements. First and Last Mile focuses on the immediate roadway links and border crossings handling cross-border goods. Port-to-Port expands this view by examining connections among border crossings and ports within each border region, including major routes to warehouses, intermodal sites, maritime ports, inland ports, railyards, and airports. Finally, Region-to-Region aims to strengthen cross-regional ties between Texas and Mexico, fostering broader economic growth.

Because First and Last Mile and Port-to-Port connectivity focus on specific local issues and infrastructure elements, TxDOT developed the [Connectivity WebApp](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/5e8d7ac50fd7460c95704982727e95cd/page/Highway-Connectivity-Challenges/) as a user-friendly, data-driven platform. This tool provides an in-depth look at connectivity challenges through interactive maps and data layers, allowing users to explore needs, view proposed solutions, and track current investments—all in one place.

The brief overview below highlights major recommendation themes and focus areas; for a full list of proposed projects and detailed policies, please consult the Texas–Mexico Border Region Connectivity Plan:

*   **Improving First and Last Mile Connectivity:** Recommendations include project to provide safer sidewalks, shaded pedestrian paths, dedicated bicycle lanes, better bus access near international bridges, and more frequent transit service. Streamlined operations and expanded border staffing are also discussed to reduce stop-and-go congestion on bridge approaches.
*   **Improving Port-to-Port Connectivity:** Expanding key highways and simplifying overweight/oversize permitting between maritime ports and border crossings are cornerstones for smoother port-to-port movements. These recommendations also explore policy changes that could allow 53-foot containers from Texas ports to move into Mexico without costly transloading delays.
*   **Improving Region-to-Region Connectivity:** These recommendations focus on strategically upgrading the border region's roads to interstate standards and improving rest areas and truck parking facilities. But the recommendations extend beyond infrastructure investments, advocating for advanced border processing technologies and the possibility of a binational oversight agency to optimize POE operations. These measures can cut paperwork, streamline trade, and keep people and goods moving.
